My passion for making and breaking stuff enthralled me to continue my career in programming. Thanks to git the breaking stuff part is manageable in my case. So I can confidently say no creatures have been harmed ever during this process.
When it comes to tech stack, I am like jack of all trades, but master of none (Not yet)! Kotlin is something which is looking like a good candidate for this mastery right now.
I am easily enthralled with tech which makes human life easier and if I could I would automate every single thing (and make all humans sleep in a pod forever). 
Yes I am one of those devs who can spend 3 hours for writing a code which takes like 10 minutes of manual efforts per person. Developer productivity is very crucial to me.

<br>

Inclusivity, diversity and equality is close to my heart, and my optimisim says we can definitely reach closer to a utopian society.
We just gotta keep trying to reach there. I am also part of [Network Of Women, Pune](https://twpune.github.io/NOW "Visit NOW homepage")
and we recently went remote like every other thing these days of covid pandemic, so don't feel shy if you'ld like to connect for more info either as a speaker or otherwise.

<br>

Currently, I am building cool stuff (with minimum destruction possible) as a tech consultant and App Dev at @Thoughtworks.

<br>

Apart from programming I like to draw, do biking, trying to figure out the procreate world and create interesting content.
